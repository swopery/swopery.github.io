Hello! My name is Ryan Swope, I am a Computer Science major at Middlebury College. This website is part web-design playground and part self-promotion. I use this space to experiment with web-design, but also to display my resume and projects I am working on or have completed in the past. I am more interested in back-end programming, and the bulk of my experience is in Java and Python. However, I am also working on things like this website as a way of rounding myself as a developer. 

If you wish to contact me regarding any of this, please see the contact tab above for ways to do so
