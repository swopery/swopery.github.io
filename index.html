<h2>Hello!</h2>

	My name is Ryan Swope, I am a Computer Science major at Middlebury College. I use this space to experiment with web-design, but also to display my resume and projects I am working on or have completed in the past. Please see my Github, LinkedIn, and resume -- all of which are linked to on this site -- for information regarding my technical skills, work experience, and body of work!
